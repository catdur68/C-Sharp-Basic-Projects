# C-Sharp-Basic-Projects

1) CarInsuranceNew: this .NET MVC very basic web app allows a user to request a car insurance quote after answering a few questions. The app also has an admin view with all CRUD functions. In this project, the database is created first, then dynamically populated as a result of user inputs (be it a potential customer or an admin person).

2) CodeFirstEF: this is another .NET MVC basic web app where the code creates the database, a single table with 3 fields. The app has the same CRUD abilities. The table is created from the code, and populated from user input from the web. 

Both projects utilize the Entity Frameworks.
